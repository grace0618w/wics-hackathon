    <h1>Thought Journaling</h1>

    <a class="center-link" href="index.html">Home</a>

    <p>&#128214; Here, you can freely express your thoughts and feelings in a private, peaceful journal. Once you’ve poured out your heart, feel the weight of your worries lift, leaving you with a sense of calm and clarity. Nothing you write will be saved.</p>

    <textarea style="background-color: rgb(203, 224, 234);" id="myTextBox" rows="6" cols="155" placeholder="Write down your thoughts here <3 <3 <3"></textarea>

    <h2>Not sure where to start? Here are some tips:</h2>

    <div class="tips-container">
        <div class="tip">
            <h2>1. Create a Comfortable Space</h2>
            <p>Find a quiet, cozy spot where you can focus without distractions. Whether it's a corner of your room, a soft blanket, or a favorite café, your space can help set the tone for reflection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h2>2. Write for Yourself, Not for Others</h2>
            <p>This journal is your personal space, so don't worry about grammar, spelling, or how it sounds. Write freely, without judgment. The goal is self-expression, not perfection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h2>3. Start Small</h2>
            <p>If you’re unsure where to begin, start with a few sentences. You can always write more later. Some days, just a paragraph or a few lines is enough to clear your mind.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h2>4. Write Daily, Even if It’s Brief</h2>
            <p>Consistency helps you build a habit. Even if you only have five minutes, writing daily can help you stay connected with your thoughts and emotions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h2>5. Use Prompts for Inspiration</h2>
            <p>If you're stuck, try prompts like:
                <ul>
                    <li>How am I feeling today?</li>
                    <li>What’s one thing I’m grateful for right now?</li>
                    <li>What’s weighing on my mind?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h2>6. Reflect on the Positive</h2>
            <p>While it's great to vent, take time to write about the good moments too. It could be a small joy, a kind gesture, or something you're proud of. This helps balance your thoughts and nurtures positivity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h2>7. Write Like You're Talking to a Friend</h2>
            <p>If you're feeling overwhelmed, write to your journal as if you’re confiding in a trusted friend. This can make your writing feel less formal and more freeing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h2>8. Track Your Progress</h2>
            <p>If you're working through something specific (like anxiety, a goal, or self-improvement), track your progress. Review your past entries occasionally to see how far you’ve come.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h2>9. Embrace Free Writing</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, just letting your pen flow without direction can uncover hidden thoughts. Let your mind wander and see where it takes you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h2>10. End with Kindness</h2>
            <p>Finish your entries with a positive note—whether it’s an affirmation, something you're looking forward to, or a reminder that you're doing your best. This leaves your journal on a calm, hopeful vibe.</p>
